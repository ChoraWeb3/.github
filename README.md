We are solving the problem of security for non-custodial crypto wallets. Self-custody is a heavy burden because you are solely responsible for the safety of your keys which can be lost, stolen, or compromised in a cyberattack. We want to change that and give our users peace of mind while providing a web3 experience with no compromises on sovereignty, security, and convenience.
